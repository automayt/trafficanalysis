pass: infected

MTA Notes:  
- Today's Trickbot infection spread from the infected Windows client to the Domain Controller (DC), and I think it was caused by Trickbot's mwormDll64 module.  
- As early as 2019-09-16, Trickbot modules mshareDll64 and mwormDll64 replaced the old shareDll64 and wormDll64 modules.  
- Since then, this is the first time I've run a Trickbot infection within an Active Directory (AD) environment.  
- With the old modules, an infected client would download a Trickbot EXE from a .png URL and send that over SMB to a vulnerable DC.  
- In today's example with the new mshareDll64 and mwormDll64 modules, the vulnerable DC downloaded Trickbot from a .png URL.  
- No Trickbot EXE was sent from the infected client to the DC, like I'd seen before.
